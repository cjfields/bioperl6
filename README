=BioPerl 6 (bioperl-experimental)=

The experimental classes in this directory are test implementations for Perl 6.
Most of these are similar to perl5-based BioPerl with simple Perl 6
translations. Hear thar be dragoons.

=Notes on Perl 6=

Perl 6 is a specification and thus can represent multiple implementations. We
recommend strictly following the Perl6 spec, defined in a series of synopses:

http://feather.perl6.nl/syn/

Note that much of the specification is still in flux or is unfinished; much of
this is due to changes from experimenting with several preliminary Perl 6
implementations, such as Pugs or Rakudo (Perl 6 on Parrot), and parsing Perl 6
using Larry Wall's STD.pm grammar. 

Once the Perl 6 specification is considered complete, BioPerl 6 would then be
expected to run on any Perl 6 implementation passing the official Perl 6 test
suite. Until then, we will recommend the latest Parrot build from subversion
along with the latest Rakudo checkout (currently packaged with Parrot but soon
to be located in a separate repository). 

For the time being the code in this directory will be targeting Rakudo (always
the latest build).
